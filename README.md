This code is intended to be used with the Anaconda Distribution of Python available here: https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual  
Scroll to the bottom of the installer page where it says "Anaconda Installers" and select the correct one for your operating system  

Inside an Anaconda Prompt or Terminal you can use the included py_env.yml file to execute:
>conda env create -f py_env.yml  

which will automatically create the crop_model environment with the necessary packages to run the Py_SSM_iCrop2 code.

An example of running the code is displayed below:

First activate the crop_model environment from (base) anaconda environment:
>conda activate crop_model  
OR  
>source activate crop_model  

Then run the model:
>python py_ssm_icrop2.py -if Test_Inputs -w Test_Outputs

Both -if (inputs folder) and -w (write) should be folders.
Depending on your system you may need to include the full absolute filepaths to the python file and the I/O folders.
